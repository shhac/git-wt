## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- **Display Name Bug in Interactive Navigation**
  - Fixed incorrect display names for worktrees in `gwt go` command
  - Previously used flawed "-trees" path heuristic to identify main repository
  - Now properly compares paths with repository root for accurate identification
  - Worktrees outside standard "-trees" directory now display correctly

### Technical Details
- Updated `listWorktreesWithTime` and `listWorktreesWithTimeSmart` functions
- Now use `getRepoInfo()` to get actual repository root path

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- **Interactive UI Rendering Improvements**
