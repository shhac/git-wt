# TODO

## Future Enhancements

### Additional ideas for consideration
- Support for custom worktree naming patterns via config file
- Integration with git aliases for even shorter commands
- Support for worktree templates (predefined setups for different project types)
- Add `move` command to relocate a worktree
- Support for configuration file:
  - User-level: `~/.config/git-wt/config`
  - Project-level: `.git-wt.toml`
  - Environment variable overrides
