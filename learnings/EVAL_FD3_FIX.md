# The eval Command and fd3 Mechanism Fix

## Discovery Date: 2025-01-24

## Issue Summary

Users reported that `gwt go` in interactive mode showed "üìÅ Navigating to: [main]" but didn't actually change directories. Investigation revealed that the fd3 mechanism wasn't working due to incorrect use of `eval` in the shell function.

## Root Cause

The shell alias was using:
```bash
cd_cmd=$(GWT_USE_FD3=1 eval "$git_wt_bin" go --no-tty $flags 3>&1 1>&2)
```

The problem with this approach:
1. `eval` was parsing `"$git_wt_bin"` as the complete command
2. The arguments `go --no-tty` were being passed to `eval`, not to the git-wt binary
3. This caused the environment variable `GWT_USE_FD3=1` to not be properly passed to the git-wt process
4. As a result, `fd.isEnabled()` returned false, causing the fallback "Navigating to:" message

## The Fix

Remove `eval` entirely - it's not needed:
```bash
cd_cmd=$(GWT_USE_FD3=1 "$git_wt_bin" go $flags 3>&1 1>&2)
```

## Why eval Was There

The `eval` was likely added to handle cases where the binary path might contain spaces or special characters. However:
1. The path is already quoted (`"$git_wt_bin"`)
2. Shell variable expansion happens before command execution
3. `eval` adds an unnecessary layer of parsing that breaks environment variable passing

## What This Fix Enables

1. **Arrow-key navigation returns**: We no longer need to force `--no-tty` mode
2. **Better user experience**: Users can use arrow keys in interactive mode
3. **Proper fd3 mechanism**: The cd command is correctly captured and executed

## Lessons Learned

1. **eval is rarely needed**: Most shell scripting tasks don't require eval
2. **eval can break environment variables**: The extra parsing layer can interfere with environment variable passing
3. **Test the actual mechanism**: We should have tested whether `GWT_USE_FD3` was being detected, not just whether navigation worked
4. **Workarounds can mask root causes**: Forcing `--no-tty` made navigation work but hid the real issue

## Testing the Fix

```bash
# Before fix - fd3 not detected
echo "1" | GWT_USE_FD3=1 eval "/path/to/git-wt" go --no-tty
# Shows: "üìÅ Navigating to: [main]"

# After fix - fd3 properly detected  
echo "1" | GWT_USE_FD3=1 "/path/to/git-wt" go --no-tty
# Shows: (no navigating message, just outputs "cd /path/to/repo" to fd3)
```
